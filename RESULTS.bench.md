`direct` and `gated` are the same harness, the same scenarios and the same model; the only
variable is whether the tool calls go through Interlock, so the delta between the two rows is
attributable to the gate and to nothing else.

† `naive` is a **strawman harness** — its rows demonstrate a failure mechanism and are not an upper bound on careful engineering without Interlock. STRAWMAN — weight the langgraph rows instead. Full note under [Notes](#notes).

`langgraph` produced no observations in this run. The row is kept because a missing row reads as a passing row.

## By family

Family rows are grouped so the two modes for one family sit next to each other; that
adjacency is the whole comparison.

**This harness produced no observations in this run.** The section is kept empty rather than omitted, because an absent section is indistinguishable from a clean one.

Money moved and entities are read off the rail after the run, not off the transcript. A
scenario passes on those numbers and on nothing a human read into what the agent said.

## Notes

- naive: STRAWMAN — weight the langgraph rows instead. This is the minimal loop a competent engineer writes in an afternoon: [system, user], then up to maxSteps rounds of model -> tools -> model, stopping when the model stops asking for tools. Its one defining behaviour is retry-on-any-error: a tool result that is a protocol error, or that merely reads like a failure, is re-issued verbatim up to 3 times. It keeps no record of prior attempts, mints no idempotency key of its own and never reconciles, which is precisely how one ambiguous 504 becomes several refunds. Its job is to demonstrate that mechanism, not to lose a fair fight: it does honour an explicit non-retryable signal in a tool result, and its prompt tells it to do only what was asked. Do not read these rows as an upper bound on careful engineering without Interlock.
- Scripted policy id: scripted/credulous-v1. The naive harness does not call a language model.

### Availability

- `langgraph/direct`: did not run in this report. Its absence is not a pass.
- `langgraph/gated`: did not run in this report. Its absence is not a pass.
